# What is ignite

ignite is a set of spark applications that will work on transforming data from tests into 
tensorized forms that can be used for machine learning.  The spark jobs will consume parquet
files generated by tests, perform data cleaning on it, normalize it, in some cases do some
preliminary stemming, tokenization or other NLP data prep, and tensorize the data.

## Motivation

Data from test failures is a potential treasure trove of data that should be plumbed.  This 
data can include:

- the logs of the tests
- all the tests that ran, how long it took, and any metadata about the tests
- logs from dependency services
- metrics of services the test was dependent on at the time of failure
- dependency task logs (did the test require other jobs to run and what was their status)
- What were the code commits (if any) from the successful runs to the failed runs?
- Did the test data change if it is dynamic?

All of this information can give us insights into why services fail, and if there is some kind
of pattern.  We could attempt to:

- classify errors
- predict errors
- find anomalies

## Building

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).

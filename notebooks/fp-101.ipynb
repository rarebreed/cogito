    "\n",
    "This document is a guide to help you learn how to think in a functional data oriented style\n",
    "and move away from imperative, side-effectful and OOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lessons will cover the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why FP and data oriented programs are the future\n",
    "- Modern type systems\n",
    "- Expressions vs. statements\n",
    "- Thinking in terms of data instead of \"Objects\"\n",
    "- What side effects are and how to encapsulate them\n",
    "- Handling errors and nulls\n",
    "- Imperative vs compostion programming\n",
    "- Advaced FP: Pure Functional programming (scala3)\n",
    "- Advanced types: Higher Kinded Types (scala3)\n",
    "- Advanced types: typeclasses (scala3)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting, I wanted to go over why I wanted to create this tutorial.  I have been dabbling in \n",
    "Functional Programming for about 9 years which was when I first heard about clojure.  At the time, I was feeling frustrated with Java, but I couldn't really put my finger on _why_ I was frustrated. I had heard Scala being called _Java.next_, so I bought Odersky's book and started reading it.  After a couple of chapters, I gave up because there were too many \"usually\"s for my taste.  Like you \"usually\" didn't need to add a semi-colon which reminded me too much of Perl (friends don't let friends code in perl of javascript less than version es6).  But still, Java felt wrong and I couldn't really articulate why.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I [read][-slides]/[watched][-video] Rich Hickey's article about State and how we were doing it all wrong.  It was an eye-opener.  I felt like I had some Hallelujah moment and a prophet was speaking to me.  Although the article was about state and how OOP got it all wrong, I was also intrigued by clojure itself; a lisp dialect.  Lisps are the first functional programming language, and the 2nd oldest of all (the oldest extant since no one does Algol anymore).  How is that a 60+ year old language is still around and kicking?  While clojure's light has somewhat dimmed, why was it so hot a couple years ago?\n",
    "\n",
    "Clojure helped with two banes of programmers existence:\n",
    "\n",
    "- brought some sanity to mutation of values, especially in a multithreaded context\n",
    "- reintroduced many to FP constructs including immutability, higher ordered functions, and everything is a function\n",
    "\n",
    "Clojure and Scala helped functional programming be in the spotlight again. This tutorial will hopefully explain why FP concepts are so powerful, and why the Java language itself is moving away from OOP.  I will also make a case for why hybrid OOP/FP is not such a great idea, and why pure functional programming has some advantages over regular FP.\n",
    "\n",
    "## FP is the future\n",
    "\n",
    "It's been several years now that people have been talking about Functional Programming.  Every recent popular language (with the possible exception of golang) has leaned more towards FP than imperative OOP.  But what **is** Functional Programming anyway?  FP doesn't really have a standard definition, but it does tend to follow a majority of these tenets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions as first class entities\n",
    "    - Allows higher order functions\n",
    "    - Functions as values\n",
    "- Anonymous functions (aka lambdas)\n",
    "- Preference for pure functions\n",
    "- Expressions over statements\n",
    "- Functions as control structures\n",
    "- Control flow as composition of functions over imperative sequencing\n",
    "- Data is data\n",
    "- Parametric or ad-hoc polymorphism (generics) over subtyping polymorphism (inheritance)\n",
    "- Structural (what a data type has) over Nominal (what a data type is) subtyping\n",
    "- Advanced type systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We will go into why this style has many innate advantages, but before we go too far let's talk about the elephant in the room: the naysayers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many engineers felt threatened that their OOP skill set would become obsolete, and so there has been quite a bit of FUD being spread around whether intentional or not.  About a decade or so ago, many people were trying to pooh-pooh on FP, saying:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It works for the Ivory Tower academics, but not us real world developers\n",
    "- OOP only fails when people dont follow its principles (encapsulation, preferring composability, etc)\n",
    "- SOLID principles makes FP unnecessary\n",
    "- OOP is intuitive, FP is for mathematicians\n",
    "- FP is only good for some problems but isn't good for others (eg, UI programming)\n",
    "- FP is so slow because you cant mutate anything\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many many things being said about FP, some of it (partially) true, but quite a bit of it was just sheer ignorance (whether unknowlingly or not, I can't say).  I often wonder how much of it was caused by people unwilling to learn something new, and toss out a skillset they spent so much time on.  For example, React followed many FP principles and showed that not only _could_ FP be used for UI programming, it was in fact probably the _best_ model.  The same could be said of redux or mobx as front end state stores for Single Page Apps.  And while it's true that FP in a single threaded context is slower than imperative \"mutate in place\" programming, immutability makes parallel programming much easier to handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention this FUD, because as engineers and scientists, our job is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create the most efficient product possible\n",
    "- Use the least amount of engineering resources before AND after the product is shipped\n",
    "- Create a product that is not only easily testable, but easy to pinpoint where the failure is\n",
    "- Engineer the product in a manner that can be reasoned about more simply\n",
    "- Write it in a way that can be changed as easily as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "We should be _embracing_ new paradigms rather than trying to knock them down because we either don't want to learn something new or feel like our existing skillset is obsolete.  The fact of the matter is that technology is _always_ changing. If you don't want to learn something new because you're an expert 10 yr veteran of technology X, but don't want to lose out to the snot-nosed kid who knows technology Y (which has advantages over X), then frankly, you are in the wrong career.\n",
    "\n",
    "As engineers and scientists, we should always keep our eyes open for new ways of doing things, and an open mind to realize any potential.  On the flip side of the coin, we can't jump on every new bandwagon because the internet thinks it is hot.  Here, I am talking about people getting all excited about some new framework, stack or library. Rather, we should consider the paradigm and conceptual ideas those frameworks, stacks or libraries are built on top of.\n",
    "\n",
    "React became such a huge hit not because it was made by Facebook, but because it actually solved a lot of pain that Angular (by Google) or jQuery did not resolve.  React solved problems not just because it had a cleaner API, or better docs, or was \"easier\".  React was built on a reactive paradigm (which is a lose relative Functional Reactive Programming), and it with redux, helped with a lot of the pain seen in front end applications when dealing with state change.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a last appeal to entice you to spend the effort to learn Functional Programming, I hope I can convince you that in the long run, it will save you time and effort.  Afterall, we have a limited amount of time.  So if you spend precious time learning a new skill, it should pay itself off over time by making you more productive in the long run.\n",
    "\n",
    "## But I can solve these problems already\n",
    "\n",
    "This headline above is a common answer that many have when presented with a new way of doing things.  I believe that these engineers either think:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Coding in that style is not as productive because\n",
    "    - It's too abstract or hard to get right\n",
    "    - It takes too much time to line up all your ducks in row (eg, think Haskell)\n",
    "- New technologies are unproven and not \"battle tested\"\n",
    "- Managers won't want to try it, because \"where will we find people who know this new tech?\"\n",
    "- Or Managers will think it requires whole team buy-in which is harder to do (which is true)\n",
    "- The problems being faced are exaggerated\n",
    "- The problems can be solved if engineers are just more diligent and disciplined or follow convention\n",
    "- There isn't enough 3rd party support to make it worthwhile\n",
    "\n",
    "While every paradigm has its pros and cons, we need to ask ourselves if the benefits outweigh the negatives.  So let's look at each of these claims\n",
    "\n",
    "### Productivity suffers\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument here is that if an engineer is already productive in say Java, what's the benefit to moving to Kotlin or scala3?  Afterall, the engineer will be far more productive in a language they have tons of experience with right?\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's tackle what we _really_ mean by `productive`.  All too often, engineers and managers especially, have a very limited view of productivity.  In a narrow mindset, productivity means \"how many features can you implement or bugs can you fix per sprint?\".  The narrowness here is all too common and doesn't factor things outside of actual coding like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing documentation\n",
    "    - in the small (API docs) \n",
    "    - In the large (tutorials, HLA, specs, notebooks, wikis etc)\n",
    "- Testing your code\n",
    "    - Writing unit tests and test case requirements\n",
    "    - Doing ad-hoc testing\n",
    "- Time spent debugging and triaging or responding to pager alerts\n",
    "    - Time spent creating or updating tickets like Jira or github issues\n",
    "    - Analyzing reports or APM metrics\n",
    "- Time _thinking_ about the problem \n",
    "    - What actually needs to be done versus what is requested\n",
    "    - Thinking about how to make the code reusable\n",
    "- Reading other people's code\n",
    "    - Code reviews \n",
    "    - Understanding what someone else's code does to fix, refactor or use it\n",
    "- Getting your code to actually build (fighting with dependencies, maven, gradle, etc)\n",
    "- Dealing with infrastructure\n",
    "    - Getting your test fixtures or other test system infrastructure right\n",
    "    - Getting CI/CD right (jenkins jobs, ansible playbooks, custom shell scripts, deployments, etc)\n",
    "- Going to meetings or informal discussions about a feature with engineers, PM's, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, actually coding is just one small portion of your life as an engineer. Yet, for some reason, too many people just equate \"productivity\" with how fast you can release a feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the few lessons I learned in my Software Engineering class was that 80% of the time spent on a feature was after code was launched (maintenance and fixes).  I will attempt to explain throughout the course of the book, that FP will save you time on the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Time spent debugging\n",
    "- Writing tests\n",
    "- Making code reusable\n",
    "\n",
    "Those three factors reduce the amount of time you will spend over the life of the code, and not just the \"release\" phase of the software's lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will go more deeply into how and why FP will make you more productive _in the long run_.  I will make the case that pure FP programs will be easier to reason about, easier to test, and be easier to reuse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unproven and untested\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this argument really isn't valid anymore.  I heard it a lot 4 years ago, but I barely hear it now.  I think that many functionally based libraries have come along to dispel this notion.  React and redux are probably the most well known libraries, but all the ReactiveX libraries (eg RxJava or Project Reactor for Spring) also come to mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How do we find people who know FP?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably _the_ most common argument I hear against FP.  It's usually said by managers, but I have heard many engineers echo this too.  The answer to this is, \"you learn it on the job if you can't find new hires\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things I like looking for in any potential candidate is how many languages and frameworks they have actually used.  It gives me a rough idea of a couple things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are interested in expanding their knowledge\n",
    "- It shows that they know several ways to skin a cat\n",
    "- It shows that they can think differently\n",
    "\n",
    "Any engineer worth his salt should be able to pick up Functional Programming principles.  That being said, _pure_ Functional Programming is quite another level.  While I don't think haskell is harder to learn than C++, many of the concepts are very abstract.  Also, the level of discipline required to set everything up can be very challenging.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why I recommend that a developer first learns normal FP first and learn pure FP later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team buy in\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably the only argument that I actually buy.  While I believe that all engineers _can_ learn FP, the truth is that many simply don't want to.  Unless they are forced to by management, many engineers are very happy doing what they have always done, and will resent having to learn not just a new programming language, but a new way about how to solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mention later, our job as an engineer is about efficiency and robustness.  We _should_ be using paradigms and concepts that improves those.  And as I mentioned above about productivity, I would hope that this is a good enough reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Except I know it isnt.  Some engineers will have to be dragged kicking and screaming, even if it will benefit them in the long run.  I've known engineers who practically said they would quit, if they had to learn a revision control system (yeah....I'm that old).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exaggerated problems with OOP\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Explain how even simple OOP programs can have hidden bugs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## How OOP failed us\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's keep an open mind and consider that we should be doing something different.  I will argue that OOP has failed us by making things more complicated than they needed to be.  Or rather, I should say OOP + Imperative programming (which is pretty much what everyone does).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't believe me, the [Java architects themselves have explicitly stated][-java-blog] they are moving towards a more data-oriented style of programming.  This can be seen in several new features they have made that all borrow from FP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Record types: immutable data containers\n",
    "- Value types (Project Loom): goes hand in hand with records, and is a huge performance boost\n",
    "- Sealed types: Enums on steroids that allow you to specify a limited set of related types\n",
    "- Pattern matching: Only works with immutable types but allows destructuring and matching of data\n",
    "\n",
    "The java architects have also gone on the record admitting other failures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optional was a half baked way to try to manage the disaster of null\n",
    "- Checked Exceptions sounded nice in theory, but failed in practice\n",
    "- Getting the wrong defaults for many things\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the biggest failing of Java is just the concept of OOP itself which Java embraced 100%.  You can't even create a standalone function without embedding it into a class.  Then there's the whole primitives/arrays vs Object divide (which Project Loom should resolve). But why did OOP fail, and why is Java, the mid 90s champion of OOP, deciding to move on? At least, as much as it can since it is hobbled by legacy support and will probably never be able to completely divorce itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP and imperative programming failed us in several ways\n",
    "\n",
    "- Side effects were paid little thought, and only pure FP languages with advanced type systems can even track side effects\n",
    "- Defaulted to mutable rather than immutable data\n",
    "- Standalone functions either had no representation at all (java <=7>) or are hobbled (java8+)\n",
    "- Imperative programming assumes synchronous programming and a sequential style\n",
    "- Exception handling was handled in its own little world, rather than being treated as a type\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side effects are an afterthought\n",
    "\n",
    "Side effects are so much an afterthought, that some engineers don't even know what the term means unless they have learned a FP language!  I wrote an article on Dev Zone and talked about misconceptions around Functional Programming.  I saw more than one comment say that \"if my code intended to change an outside variable or write to a file, that's not a side effect since my purpose was to do that!\".  Unfortunately, that's the colloquial definition of a side effect: an unintended consequence of some other action.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Programming Language Theory, side effect has a much more precise definition.  A side effect is when a function either affects the \"outside world\" (anything out of scope of the function itself or the arguments passed into the function) or the result is affected by the outside world.  For example, any kind of IO operation like reading from or writing to a file, a network socket or even the console is a side effect.  Another more insidious side effect is time.  Time is an implicit factor of state (state is defined as \"value of an object at a point in time\"), and it is insidious because it is hidden.  Race conditions happen because of time.  A function could fail because the file that used to exist changed a millisecond ago isn't the same _now_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Side effectful functions therefore are not _pure_.  A pure function is a function that obeys a couple of laws:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It can't have side effects\n",
    "- Therefore, given the same arguments, it will always give you the same answer\n",
    "- As a consequence of the above, a pure function is immune to time (an implicit argument in side effecting functions)\n",
    "- By implication, a pure function must return something or the answer is never known\n",
    "\n",
    "Pure functions therefore are immune to the outside world and also do not disturb the outside world.  The only way to interact with a pure function is to give it inputs and recieve an output.  Because the only thing a pure function cares about are the arguments you pass in, they are much easier to reason about.  You don't have to think about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the function is being called\n",
    "- If some service is down\n",
    "- If some file or filesystem exists\n",
    "- A race condition with some other function\n",
    "- Mutating an argument that was passed in that another function may need\n",
    "\n",
    "And many other things.  You may be arguing that OOP can have pure functions, and you would be correct.  However, the very notion of OOPS is that it combines data (really state) with behavior.  The methods of a class are driven by the current state of the object, or update the state of the object.  It's practically designed to be impure.  Purity in a function makes it very easy to reason about, whereas in OOP you always have to wonder what is changing under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of a pure function, think about addition.  You give addition 2 numbers, and you get back a number.  Addition doesn't mutate the numbers you put in.  It doesn't send the answer to a service which might return a 500.  It doesn't save the result to a file.  It doesn't even write the answer to STDOUT.  One could argue that if we don't have _some_ side effect, then how would we ever know what the answer was?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is entirely correct.  If you do a pure computation, you would never be able to know what the compued result was!  So at some point, you **must** do side effects.  So this is where _pure_ FP differs from regular FP.  In a pure FP environment side effects are described in the type system itself, and the main program is just some kind of type that performs IO.  The trick is safely encapsulating the pure part of the computation from the impure part.\n",
    "\n",
    "By treating side effects as a first class construct, we now know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- where the side effects are\n",
    "- how to separate or encapsulate the pure parts from the impure parts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Immutability\n",
    "\n",
    "Going hand in hand with side effects is immutability.  One extemely popular language doesn't even _have_ the concept of\n",
    "immutability (cough, python, hack...and yes, I know eg an `int` is immutable, but you can not declare a variable itself\n",
    "as unchanging since there is nothing like `final`, `const`, or `val` in python).  But why should we care about\n",
    "immutability? Why has it become so important in modern language design?\n",
    "\n",
    "It comes down to two things really:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Being able to reason about code when a variable cant change\n",
    "- Being safe for sharing across threads\n",
    "\n",
    "It's even unfortunate that we use the term _variable_ to denote \"things that hold a value\".  The problem is that while variable can mean \"something that can be substitued for\", we don't have a way to distinguish _how many times_ you can perform the substitution (only on initialization, or even afterwards?).  Some languages might differentiate them with a `const` or `final` modifier, or perhaps distinguishing between `val` and `var` (kotlin and scala do this), but we still call them _variables_ unfortunately.  Or even more confusingly \"constant variable\" or \"immutable variable\".  How can something be constant or immutable, and also _variable_?  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an unfortunate legacy of programming.  Even the age old lisp called them `vars` or `defs`, but at least lisp also separated out the idea of the _name_ of variable (a `Symbol`) from the thing the symbol referred to (the data it represented).  \n",
    "\n",
    "This sleight of hand is so second nature to us, that we just think of the name of a variable as equivalent to its value.  Unfortunately, we don't really stop to think about all the machinery going on under the hood (unless you are a C(++) or rust programmer).  Consider the following in java:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "var name = \"Sean\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `name` has a string the value of which is \"Sean\".  But what is going on in the computer?  The variable `name` is just a reference, which is really a kind of pointer to a memory address.  This memory holds a contiguous chunk of bytes, which when decoded by utf8 comes out as \"Sean\".  What would happen if I then do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "name = \"John\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Java wouldn't care.  The compiler will go, oh ok, the engineer wants to change the _value_ that `name` points to.  But what does that even mean?  There are two possibilities.  The language could either:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Change `name` to a different location in memory, where its value is \"John\"\n",
    "2. Erase the memory that `name` points to, and put \"John\" there\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `name` has a String type, and Strings are immutable in Java, Java does the first option. But what if the type wasn't immutable?  Now things get messy.  Now, the compiler will write code that might do the 2nd option.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.util.Set;\n",
    "\n",
    "class Person {\n",
    "    String name;\n",
    "    Integer age;\n",
    "    Set<String> languages;\n",
    "\n",
    "    public Person(String name, Integer age) {\n",
    "        this.name = name;\n",
    "        this.age = ahe;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    public static void main(String... args) {\n",
    "        var println = (Sring x) -> System.out.println(x)\n",
    "        // How immutable data works\n",
    "        var s = \"Sean\";\n",
    "        var s2 = s;\n",
    "        s == s2; // true.  s and s2 are the same object\n",
    "        println(s.hashCode());\n",
    "        println(s2.hashCode());  // prints the same hash code for each\n",
    "        s = \"John\";\n",
    "        println(s2);  // still prints \"Sean\"\n",
    "        s.hashCode(); // is now different\n",
    "        s == s2;  // this is now false since we changed where s is pointing to\n",
    "\n",
    "        // how mutable data works\n",
    "        var p = new Person(\"Sean\", 49);\n",
    "        var p2 = p;\n",
    "\n",
    "        p == p2; // true\n",
    "        println(p.name); // \"Sean\n",
    "        println(p2.name); // also \"Sean\"\n",
    "        p.name = \"Alex\";  // What do you think p2.name is?\n",
    "        println(p2.name)\n",
    "        p == p2;  // This is still true.\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A source of never ending confusion is that in the example above, when you change `p.name`, since `p2` is pointing to the same memory, although p2.name _does_ change, their hashcodes are still equal.  This _might_ be what you want, but more often than not, most programmers assume that p2 is just a copy of the data, and thus shouldn't change.  So already, immutable is more intuitive!\n",
    "\n",
    "And we aren't even doing multithreaded programming yet!  If you have some object, and the values inside the object can change over time, you now have to keep track of who could change the data, and when, evem in a single threaded environment.  If you forgot that that some other component had access to the object, or even part of the object, then you might be surprised when the answer doesn't come out the way you think.\n",
    "\n",
    "How about kotlin?  Is it different?\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "import \n",
    "data class Person(var name: String, val age: Int, val languages: Set<String> = setOf())\n",
    "// to make this in scala3, just do case class instead\n",
    "// case class Person(name: String, age: Int, languages: Set<String> = Set())\n",
    "\n",
    "val p = Person(\"Sean\", 49)\n",
    "val p2 = p\n",
    "p2 == p \n",
    "p.name = \"John\"\n",
    "p2 == p // true\n",
    "p2.name // \"John\n",
    "val p3 = Person(\"Sean\", 49)\n",
    "p3 == p // true because kotlin does \"value\" equality, not refernece equality\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can see that kotlin and scala still follow the same rules, except that you have to explicitly state whether a variable is mutable or immutable right at declaration.  So you have to think right at the begining what you want.  In java, it defaults to mutable, so unless you really know ahead of time, you might forget to add `final`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's bad enough in a single threaded environment where any field with a setter (public or private) can change your data.  Now imagine multiple threads having access.  But wait!! Isn't `private` supposed to help me by limiting who can set the value?  The problem doesn't go away with private setters.  Because the problem isn't just \"who\" changes the data, but \"when\".  Again, time is your enemy because it is almost always a hidden argument in side effectful and mutable programs.   Also, if data is immutable, the compiler can perform some enhancements and guarantees, because it can reason that _no one_ can change the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rust, learning from the mistakes of so many languages made immutable variables the default, and you had to use a `mut` keyword to tell the compiler \"the value in memory can change in place\".  Kotlin, scala and javascript decided that there would be no default, and you had to specify if it was either mutable (`var`) or immutable (`val`).  Java, being an old-school language made mutability the default, and you have to tell java you want immutability by using the `final` modifier.  Even the Java architects admit this was a mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutability does have one advantage though: it's faster.  Changing the data in place is faster than copying the entire dataset.  Imagine an array with tens of thousands of elements.  You really don't want to copy the whole thing when you change a single element.  So, mutability still has its place, but be wary of it.  Unless you are using rust, whose compiler is virtually unique in being able to guarantee us that only one owner can ever modify a value at one time, even in a multithreaded environment, prefer immutability unless performance is critical.  Performance and safety: that's why rust is so loved.  But, alas, this tutorial is mostly for those of stuck in GC'ed languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lack of top level functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Java was designed to be a 100% OOP language.  Unlike some of its contemporaries like C++ or python which were mixed paradigm languages, Java went hog-wild on OOP and effectively made it the _only_ way to program.  Java didn't realize the error of its ways for many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next to Generics (released in Java 5), the biggest change to the platform came with Java 8's lambdas.  But even lambdas are somewhat crippled.  Why?  Lambdas must still be embedded inside a class.  There is no way to define a function that exists on its own.  It must belong to a class.  However, at least lambdas meant that they could be stores in variables, passed in as arguments, or returned from functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there's actually a deeper problem lurking, and it can be seen by how Scala3 solved it.  In java, because there are _only_ classes, there really is no such thing as a _function_.  Saying \"function\" in Java is technically incorrect, because there are only _methods_.  Why does that matter?  You can read more about [eta expansion][-eta] in the scala3 docs, but think about it this way: in the JVM, methods have an implicit object passed to them (named `this`).  What does _this_ refer to when you have top level methods that don't exist in a class?\n",
    "\n",
    "This can also be seen in kotlin, where [function types][-ft] are different from method references. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val lowered: (String) -> String = { name ->\n",
    "    name.lowercase(Locale.getDefault())\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class Named(val name: String) {\n",
    "    compantion object {\n",
    "        fun toLower(name: String): String {\n",
    "            return name.lowercase(Locale.getDefault())\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "val names = listOf(Named(\"Sean\").name)\n",
    "names.forEach(lowered)\n",
    "names.forEach(Named::toLower)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we are tripped up by an implicit value, which in this case, is either an implicit this, or a reference to a static type (the companion object here in the kotlin example).  While sometimes implicit values are useful (that's kind of one of the things Dependency Injection does for you), it can also make things harder to reason about and harder to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "And speaking of Dependency Injection, we will have a whole chapter devoted to this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imperative assumes synchronicity\n",
    "\n",
    "What's worse than OOP?  OOP with imperative programming.  Unfortunately, we all do it, including me, but I hope that I can show you over the course of this tutorial that there is another way.  But first, some disclaimers.  Is imperative programming always bad, or innately bad?  One scenario where you will want to do mutable imperative programming is when performance is critical.  While you may have heard some FP evangelists claim that FP is faster because it allows better parallelism, they usually neglect to mention that immutable persistent data structures ARE less performant, even with data structure sharing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we can't even share data structures and we just need to modify a single field in a data type.  In this scenario, you have to create a brand new object.  This can get expensive.  If you wonder why it is expensive, I will need to get into how the heap, stack, and cache work, and explain the latencies that come with each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But for now, let's concentrate on imperative sequencing.  This is so common, that we don't even stop to think that there is another possible way to program...at least until you start needing to do asynchronous programs.  Consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "var response = client.httpGet(someUrl);\n",
    "if (reponse.status != 200) {\n",
    "    log.error(\"Failed to get resource\");\n",
    "    // do something with the error\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    log.debug(\"Getting body from response\");\n",
    "    SomeClass.doWork(response.getBody());\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty cut and dry right?  First you make an http request, them you check the status and either handle an error, or do something with the response that was returned.  Easy-peasy right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless, that `httpGet` call takes forever.  So ok, you put in a timeout.  But then you have 3 things to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An actual failure (ie, a 404 or 500) from the server\n",
    "- A sucessful response\n",
    "- Or no response (within the timeframe)\n",
    "\n",
    "Or worse, what if your code times out, but was eventually successful?  On a GET this is probably not a big deal, but what if it was successful, and updated a database entry or modified a file?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, maybe it's not that simple.  But let's think even more basic.  What is this imperative code _really_ doing at its most basic essence?  To really understand this question, you have to consider that all code is one of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A statement\n",
    "- An expression\n",
    "\n",
    "These are mutually exclusive choices.  A statement doesn't return a value.  It is either an assignment, or a side effect.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```kotlin\n",
    "val x = 100l  // a statement\n",
    "println(\"x = $x\")  // this is actually an expression that returns Unit\n",
    "val y = x * 2  // an expression\n",
    "val z = if (y > 12) {  //yet another expression\n",
    "    \"more than a dozen\"\n",
    "} else {\n",
    "    \"less than a dozen\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// this is invalid kotlin or scala\n",
    "// val name: String?\n",
    "// while(val name = getNextName()) {  the assignment operator returns nothing not even Unit\n",
    "//    name = getNextName()\n",
    "// }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "FP focused languages are expression oriented.  Almost all constructs are expressions.  Java, being an imperative language has a strong preference for statements.  That is why it is called an if statement or try/catch statement in Java, because if and try blocks don't return values.  You have to do assigments inside the block.  But then Java is weird, and makes assignments return the value of the assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is really going on in a block of imperative code?  You make a call that returns a value.  You then use the returned value in a later call.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "var accessKey = Manager.getResource();\n",
    "var data = client.makeRequest(accessKey);\n",
    "var purchaseEvents = data.events.stream().filter(evt -> evt.count > 100).collect(Collectors.asLis());\n",
    "Validator.ensurePurchaseQuantity(purchaseEvents);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But, you could have just as easily done this\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Validator.ensurePurchaseQuantity(\n",
    "    client.makeRequest(\n",
    "        Manager.getResource()\n",
    "    ).events.stream().filter(evt -> evt.count > 100).collect()\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gets a little hard to read, because composition works from the inside out (eg, in f(g(x)) you solve for g(x), and then the output of it is used to solve for f).  What if we could rewrite it in a different way?  If you have used Unix at all, you are probably familiar with the pipe operator.  The pipe operator \"pipes\" the output of the command to the left, as the input to the command to the right.  It's kinf of an inverse of a mathematical composition.  So in scala, you can create not only your own operator like pipe (which in the example we will write as |>), but you can also call them in infix mode.  In kotlin, you have a limited number of operators you can override, but you can also call functions in an infix mode.  So imagine that we have an operator in scala |>, like the | operator from unix\n",
    "\n",
    "```scala\n",
    "Manager.getResource() \n",
    "  |> client.makeRequest \n",
    "  |> { data -> data.events.filter { evt -> evt.count > 100} }\n",
    "  |> Validator.ensurePurchaseQuantity\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you might be asking yourself, \"so what?  What's the difference?\".  There are a couple of differences between the two styles.  The biggest is that in the functional style, a program is nothing more than the composition of functions.  This has profound ramifications and requires a change in thinking, and designing both your problem and your code.  But by doing so, it also eliminates many common bugs which I will go over throughout the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also paves the way for solving programs which are asynchronous.  If you have ever done any amount of javascript with Promises, you may have noticed (and cursed) at how _contagious_ Promises are.  What do I mean by contagious?  Once you have something that returns a Promise, now your whole computational chain must become a Promise.  You can't have some synchronouse code \"outside\" use the value of the Promise, unless you made that code part of the Promise chain.  I often saw incorrect code like this by newbie Javascript devs:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "let someNumber = 0\n",
    "let promised = somePromiseFunction()\n",
    "  .then(p => {\n",
    "      let NewVal = getFromDb(p) // getFromDb() may take awhile\n",
    "      if (newVal > 50) {\n",
    "          someNumber = 100\n",
    "      } else {\n",

    "      }\n",
    "  })\n",
    "if (someNumber == 100) {\n",

    "    doSomething(someNumber)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "// This is how you _should_ do it\n",
    "let asyncVal = somePromiseFunction()\n",
    "  .then(p => {\n",
    "      let NewVal = getFromDb(p) // getFromDb() may take awhile\n",
    "      if (newVal > 50) {\n",
    "          return 100\n",
    "      } else {\n",
    "          return newVal\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  })\n",
    "  .then(latestVal => {\n",
    "      if (latestVal == 100) {\n",
    "          console.log(\"we were successful\")\n",
    "          return doSomething(latestVal)\n",
    "      } else {\n",
    "          return null\n",
    "      }\n",
    "  })\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will almost never print \"we were successful\", because the programmer assumed that the Promise chain ran synchronously in the same order as the code itself.  But what happens is javascipr's main event loop will kick off the `somePromiseChain` promise, but then immediately get to the line where checks what the value of `someNumber` is.  Unless `getFromDb` is really really fast, this will almost certainly fail.  This is why Javascript ES6 came with async/await syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function foo() {\n",
    "    let someNumber = 0\n",
    "    let promised = await somePromiseFunction()  // this blocks now\n",
    "    if (someNumber == 100) {\n",
    "        console.log(\"we were successful\")\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "(await foo())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, async/await is really just syntax sugar around Promises, and Promises have quite a few potential pitfalls.  The point here though is imperative programming assumes a synchronous world which may not be valid.  When you have a program which follows these rules\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- functions are pure\n",
    "- functions are well typed\n",
    "\n",
    "If the above is true, you can do something very strange and powerful when you design your program as a composition of functions that are well typed.  You can \"embed\" extra information in your function and \"carry\" them along as you traverse your computational graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explaining what I mean by \"embedding\" and \"carrying along\" \"extra information\" is going to take the rest of this book to explain.  In haskell, you will often hear about monads and functors, and hear them described as \"burritos\" or \"wrappers\".  Sometimes you will hear monads described as \"programmable semicolons\".  If you are like me, you are probably thinking \"WTF are they smoking?\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A more vague, but more precise definition, is that mathematical terms are more like _contexts_ than burritos or wrappers.  The next logical question is, \"context of what?\".  It will take awhile to explain, but think about operating on a List<T>.  When you run the `map` function on a list, you might possibly return 0 to N values, and therefore your context is that you are carrying a \"possibly empty\" new list of transforms.  As another example, when you use scala's Maybe or even kotlin's `?` to mark a nullable type, the context is \"the data may not exist\".  When you use a pure Functional language (like hakell) or a runtime (like scala's typelevel), then the `IO` type says \"there is an impure computation going on here\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of programming as the composition of functions as a graph.  In a single threaded synchronous program, it is a linear single node per vertex chain of transformations.  In a multithreaded or asynchronous application, you can have multiple nodes off of one vertex (though you now cant think of the edge as the output-input edge, but now possibly also as a \"spawned a new thread/task/coroutine\" sub-graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "But we will go into this in more detail as the book progresses.  For now, hang tight, and think about functions as compositions of functions that create a graph and that doing this can make your multithreaded and asynchronous programs easier to reason about.\n",
